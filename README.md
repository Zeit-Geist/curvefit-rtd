Callendar-Van Dusen Coefficients Calculator
This repository contains a Python program designed to calculate the coefficients of a calibrated Pt100 temperature sensor using the Callendar-Van Dusen equation. The program accepts at least three temperature and resistance values as input and outputs the corresponding coefficients.

Features
Input: Accepts a minimum of three temperature (°C) and resistance (Ω) values from a calibrated Pt100 sensor.
Output: Calculates and displays the coefficients for the Callendar-Van Dusen equation.
User-friendly command-line interface for inputting data.
Validates input data for consistency and accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.x
